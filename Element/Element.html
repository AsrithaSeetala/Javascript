     <h2> No More Video Games On Tesla Screens While Cars Are Moving </h2>
        <p> Under pressure from U.S. auto safety regulators, Tesla has agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the company will send out a software update over the Internet so the "Passenger Play" function will be locked and won't work while vehicles are in motion. </p>
        <p> The move comes one day after the agency announced it would open a formal investigation into distracted driving concerns about Tesla's video games. Some of them could be played while cars are being driven. In a statement Thursday, an agency spokeswoman says that the change came after regulators discussed concerns about the system with Tesla. </p>
 
    <h2> There are numerous kinds of journaling that exist </h2>
        <p> Journaling is the modern-day version of writing a diary. In earlier days, the diary was considered as a person's best friend as it knew all details about its owner, even their deepest darkest secrets. There are a lot of problems or other issues that a person cannot share even with their closest friend or family member. It mostly happens because the fear of being judged is too strong within us. A diary or journal on the other hand would never judge you. It will be your closest confidante. </p>
        <p> There are no restraints about what to write in a journal. There are numerous kinds of journaling that exist. </p>
