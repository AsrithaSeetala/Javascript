        <p> Under pressure from U.S. auto safety regulators, Tesla has agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving. </p>
        <p> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the company will send out a software update over the Internet so the "Passenger Play" function will be locked and won't work while vehicles are in motion. </p>
        <p> The move comes one day after the agency announced it would open a formal investigation into distracted driving concerns about Tesla's video games. </p>
        <p> Some of them could be played while cars are being driven. In a statement Thursday, an agency spokeswoman says that the change came after regulators discussed concerns about the system with Tesla. </p>
